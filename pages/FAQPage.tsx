              <Accordion.Control>What materials are used in your handicrafts?</Accordion.Control>
              <Accordion.Panel>
                Our products are made from authentic, high-quality materials. We specialize in Panchaloha (an alloy of five metals) for bronze statues, aged teakwood and rosewood for wooden sculptures, and pure brass for our lamps and pooja items. Our Tanjore paintings use 22-karat gold foil and semi-precious stones.

                We work directly with traditional artisan families and co-operatives in South India who have been practicing their craft for generations. Each piece comes with a certificate of authenticity detailing its origin and the materials used.
